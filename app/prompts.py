        A meta description is a brief summary of the content of a web page. It's an HTML attribute that provides a concise explanation of what the page is about. Meta descriptions appear in search engine results pages (SERPs) below the title tag and URL. While they don't directly impact a page's ranking in search results, they play a crucial role in attracting clicks from users.

        A well-crafted meta description should accurately describe the content of the page, entice users to click through to the website, and include relevant keywords to improve visibility in search results. Typically, meta descriptions are limited to around 150-160 characters to ensure they display properly in SERPs.
